# Modeling Face Recognition in the Predictive Coding Framework: A Combined Computational Modeling and Functional Imaging Study 
This project is an attempt to reproduce and replicate the findings from Apps & Tsakiris (2013). The idea behind the replication was to firstly, bring the model up to current standards and secondly, to use it to study the brain activity associated to face recognition in two different kinds of participants; neurotypical and participants within the Autismus Spectrum Disorder. This project however only tested neurotypical participants.
the results on our research can be soon be read in our manuscript - Modeling Face Recognition in the Predictive Coding Framework: A Combined Computational Modeling and Functional Imaging Study by Zaragoza, Niehaus, et al. 2022 (under review). 

On this repository however, you will only find the scripts for the behavioral and fMRI experiment used to acquired our data, as well as the scripts used to preprocess and analyzed the fMRI data. For more information and complete scripts on the computational modeling and behavioral analysis please see our OSF repository here: https://osf.io/tye24/
